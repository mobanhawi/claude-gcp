It also satisfies all secondary criteria: calories within 1800-2200 range, protein at least 180g, and fits within one day. However, there is a significant mathematical error where the individual meal calories (2,500) do not match the stated daily target (2,200). Despite this internal inconsistency, the stated total of 2,200 calories does meet the criteria requirements."
